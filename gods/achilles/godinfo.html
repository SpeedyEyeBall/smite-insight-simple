                <div class="lore">
                    King Agamemnon brought his fury to bear against gilded Troy,
                    for Prince Paris had stolen his Helen, his wife, whose
                    beauty rivaled that of Athena and Aphrodite. To famed
                    Achilles, invincible warrior, the king gave command of a
                    thousand ships.Across stormy seas and salted beach, soldiers
                    sieged the city. Arrow and stone, blade and barb bounced
                    from Achilles’ skin. Bathed as a babe in the River Styx by
                    his Nereid mother, his hide was hardened, imperviously made.
                    Through every charge, every death-defying battle, Achilles
                    was at the fore. Troy hung poised to crumble.Until Agamemnon
                    gave slight to the mighty myrmidon. In grave offense,
                    Achilles pulled his forces from the field. Hector, boldest,
                    bravest, eldest of the Trojan princes seized the chance to
                    push the Greeks to the sea. Water’s reflection mirrored
                    scorching sails as Hector fired their ships. All seemed lost
                    until Achilles rose to meet him. Fierce and fast the two
                    titans fought, but Hector’s spear felled Achilles fair.
                    Though Patroclus, it was, in the armor of Achilles, not
                    Achilles who lay dead.Wrathful at the loss of his faithful
                    lover, Achilles donned armor newly-made and challenged
                    Hector alone. Spear and blade and amor rang, but Achilles
                    could not be harmed. Hector, prince of Troy, died in battle
                    that day.Paris, brother lost, tearful-eyed, let arrow loose,
                    guided by divine envy. For there were Gods that could not
                    suffer Achilles to survive. Straight and true the arrow flew
                    and harpooned Achilles’ heel, where his mother held him when
                    submerged. The wound was deep, his weakness found, Achilles
                    met his end.A decade thence, from Hades’ depths, Achilles
                    has been drawn. Armored now, upon the heel, revenge his only
                    aim. For envious Gods stole from him his glory and his life.
                    Now they tremble at the wrath of the man who cannot be
                    harmed.
